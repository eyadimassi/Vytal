# Dockerfile

# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
# This is done first to leverage Docker's layer caching
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# 5. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# 6. Define the command to run the application
# We use Gunicorn here as it's a production-ready web server, unlike Flask's built-in server.
# First, install Gunicorn
RUN pip install gunicorn

# Now, set the command to run it.
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
